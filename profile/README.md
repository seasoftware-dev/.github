# Sea Software

Sea Software is a software organization that builds modern, fast, and reliable programs. Our goal is to make software that works well, is easy to understand, and is built to last. We focus on writing clean code and keeping our projects organized.

## What We Work On

We create different types of software. Many of our projects are written in C++. We also use HTML and CSS for web interfaces. To build our projects, we use tools like CMake and Makefiles. Sometimes we use shell scripts to automate simple tasks.

Each project includes clear instructions on how to set it up and build it.

## Our Standards

We try to keep our code simple and readable. Every part of the program should have a clear purpose. We avoid making things more complicated than they need to be.

When possible, we design our projects so they can be built on different operating systems. We want builds to work correctly and consistently.
